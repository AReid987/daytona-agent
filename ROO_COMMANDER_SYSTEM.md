# Roo Commander System Guidelines

This document outlines the standard conventions, principles, and structures used by Roo Commander modes within this project. All modes should adhere to these guidelines.

## 1. Core Journaling Principles

- **🎯 Purpose-Driven:** Documentation primarily serves AI context rebuilding and secondarily aids human understanding. Avoid logging for logging's sake. Focus on information needed to resume work or understand history.
- **🤖 AI Context Focus:** Structure information for efficient AI loading. Use clear headings, concise summaries, and references. Avoid large, unstructured text dumps.
- **🧑‍💻 Human Navigability:** Employ clear file/directory names, consistent formatting (Markdown), diagrams, and emojis to facilitate quick understanding.
- **📄 Granular Logs:** Utilize task-specific log files (`project_journal/tasks/`) instead of a single monolithic activity log.
- **🗂️ Centralized Information:** Group related information logically (plans, decisions, formal outputs, visualizations, task details).

_(Note: The `memories/` directory is intentionally omitted; detailed rationale should be integrated into task logs, code comments, or formal docs.)_

## 2. Standard `project_journal/` Structure

- **`tasks/`**: Contains `TASK-ID.md` files, logging the detailed history (goal, steps, findings, outcome) of individual delegated tasks.
- **`decisions/`**: Contains `YYYYMMDD-topic.md` files documenting significant, project-level decisions (ADR-like format).
- **`formal_docs/`**: Stores finalized outputs (reports, specs, guides, research summaries, API specs, audit reports, test plans, finalized configs, etc.).
- **`visualizations/`**: Stores Mermaid diagrams (architecture, DB schema, task status, workflows).
- **`planning/`**: Stores core planning documents (`requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, `project_plan.md`).
- **`technical_notes/`**: For ad-hoc technical documentation not fitting neatly elsewhere.

## 3. Standard Emoji Legend

Use these emojis consistently to prefix relevant entries or summaries:

- 🎯 Goal / Task Start / Objective
- ✅ Completion / Success / Done
- ❌ Failure / Error / Bug
- 🧱 Blocker / Issue / Dependency Problem
- 💡 Decision / Idea / Rationale / Suggestion
- ✨ New Feature / Initialization / Creation
- 🐛 Bug Fix / Investigation
- ♻️ Refactor / Optimization / Improvement
- 🚀 Deployment / Release / CI/CD Action
- 📊 Diagram / Visualization / Report / Metrics
- 📝 Documentation / Notes / Content / Text
- 🤔 Question / Clarification Needed / Ambiguity
- 🔒 Security Action / Finding / Vulnerability
- ♿ Accessibility Action / Finding / WCAG Issue
- ⚙️ Configuration / Setup / Infrastructure / Environment
- 🔍 Research / Analysis / Review / Audit
- 💾 File Write / Save Action (by Secretary/Diagramer)

## 4. General Delegation Guidelines (via `new_task`)

- **Task ID:** Always include the relevant Task ID in the delegation message.
- **Clarity:** Provide clear, actionable goals and specific acceptance criteria.
- **Context:** Reference necessary context files (e.g., `project_journal/planning/requirements.md#section-3`, `project_journal/tasks/TASK-ABC.md`) or previous Task IDs.
- **Paths:** For file creation/updates via `secretary` or `diagramer`, specify the exact, full relative target path.

## 5. File Management

- **Code:** Modes responsible for specific code types (e.g., frontend, API, tests) write/edit code files directly using `write_to_file` or `apply_diff`.
- **Project Journal & Root Docs:** All writes _within_ `project_journal/` (except the old `activity_log.md`) and to root `README.md`/`LICENSE.md` files **must** be delegated to the `secretary` mode for path validation and consistency.
- **Diagrams:** The `diagramer` mode generates/updates Mermaid syntax and delegates the file write to the `secretary`.
